This repository hosts code and data to reproduce the model generating the ggACene (global gridded Air Conditioning energy) projections dataset.

## Running the model
To reproduce the model and generate the dataset from scratch, please refer to the following steps:
 - Download input data by cloning the repository
- Adjust the path folder in the sourcer.R script
 - Run the sourcer.R script to train the ML model and make projections

## Data download
Instead, to directly download the latest version of the (pre-generated) **ggACene** dataset (.ncdf files), access the *output_data* folder
